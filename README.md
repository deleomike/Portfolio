# Portfolio

Welcome to my Portfolio!

I have laid out a few of the reports here in the main of the repository, of these projects. 
For a quick overview of what I did, refer to those.

Table of Contents:
1. Acoustic Signals Research
    - This is my research with the Pennsylvania State University
    - I have included the proposal for the summer of 2018, as well as the product of my research
2. BattleShip Game
    - This is my final project for my Microprocessors Class, Junior Year
    - For this project, I used an object oriented coding style
    - The game is fully playable. To run it, download the Mars4_5 file, and if you have
        Java then it should run. Read the header of the battleship file for instructions on settings 
        you will need to choose to run the program.
3. FIR
    - For this project I implemented at 64 tap FIR filter
    - To do this, I first designed it in C++, so it would be easier to test
    - I made a script in matlab to evaluate the output so I was sure that it was providing the correct response
    - To test it, change the global variables indicated at the top of the file to your own file outputs/inputs
